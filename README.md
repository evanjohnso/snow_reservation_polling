# Ski Resort Reservation Tool

COVID-19 shut down unfettered access to ski resorts all across the world.
<br />
<br />
A few resorts have parking reservation systems that fill up rather quickly. This little project automates checking for cancelations.

#### Development

run `npx babel --watch src --out-dir . --presets react-app/prod`
in the root directory to get updates locally (idk what i did to require this)

This will map your changes from `src/calendar.js -> calendar.js`

To load the local host, just load up the `index.html` file, which should be
file:///Users/evanjohnson/personal/repos/snow_reservation_polling/index.html
